    <br>
    <p class="faq-question">Q: How many people per team?</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">A: Each team can have between 4-5 students. We have a strict cap at 5 students per team.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="faq-question">Q: Where are the questions from?</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">A: The questions are written exclusively by UC Berkeley student volunteers. All questions are in the official NSB style.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="faq-question">Q: What’s our “Energy” category?</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">A: BSB Fall 2023 will feature a reinvented “Energy” category based on UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab research.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="faq-question">Q: What difficulty are the questions?</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">A: The questions will range from Regionals-level in Round Robin to Nationals-level by the end of Double Elimination.</p>

    <p class="faq-question">Q: What times will the competition run from?</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">A: We expect our tournament to run from 7:30 am to 6:00 pm (<strong><a href="Tournament_Schedule.pdf" target="_blank">Projected Day Schedule</a></strong>). However, NSB tournaments often run late, so make sure to prepare for this in advance. We will do our best to reduce delays throughout the day.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="faq-question">Q: Does our team coach need to attend?</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">A: No, but we require at least <strong><span style="color: red;">one non-competing adult</span></strong> to serve as a chaperone from each school. These individuals will be responsible for communicating directly with BSB organizers on competition day.</p>

    <p class="faq-question">Q: What happens if my team is eliminated?</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">A: We have fun activities planned for eliminated teams! We encourage everyone to stay and watch the Championship round, which will be livestreamed to audiences across the country.</p>
